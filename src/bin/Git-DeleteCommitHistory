# If you are sure you want to remove all commit history,
# simply delete the .git directory in your project root (note that it's hidden).
# Then initialize a new repository in the same folder and link it to the GitHub repository:
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo

#now commit your current version of code
git add *
git commit -am 'init'

#and finally force the update to GitHub:
git push -f origin master

#However, I suggest backing up the history (the .git folder in the repository) before taking these steps!
